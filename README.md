# spambot
A simple program which uses pyautogui to spam messages in any messaging app! It's just for fun and I will request not to use in too often cause it may cause bans from those messaging platforms. 

*How to use:
Step 1: Install a IDE(i.e PyCharm, VisualStudio or anything similar)
Step 2: Install autogui(Command: pip install autogui.
Step 3: Add any script in the script file.(i.e whatever you want the program to spam.)
STep 4: Run the program and quickly switch to the messaging app.

When trying to stop just stop the program prom the IDE.

I will surely update the program if I learn any new features to add.

Thank You.
