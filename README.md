# Spambot
A simple program which uses pyautogui to spam messages in any messaging app! It's just for fun and I will request not to use in too often cause it may cause bans from those messaging platforms. 

### How to use:

## Step 1 
Install a IDE(i.e PyCharm, VisualStudio or anything similar)

## Step 2
Install autogui
```cmd 
pip install pyautogui
```
## Step 3
Add any script in the script file.(i.e whatever you want the program to spam.)

## Step 4
Run the program and quickly switch to the messaging app.

## Stopping
When trying to stop just stop the program prom the IDE.

## End Notes:
This is my first project please correct if I have done anything wrong somewhere.
I will surely update the program if I learn any new features to add.

Thank You.
